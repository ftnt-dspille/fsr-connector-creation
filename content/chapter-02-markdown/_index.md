You will be using Markdown to write the documents.
Makedown is a mark up language that is very simple.
It is very similar to clearly formatted text.

Hugo will convert the markdown text files you wrote into good looking HTML pages.

A Markdown's reference is here:
<https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/cont/markdown/index.html>

This document also serves as an example on how to write markdown for TEC.
You can see the source code of any page in this document to see how it is written.
Just click the [<i class="fab fa-markdown"></i>]()
button on the top bar.

You can also check the source code of this document
on GitLab [here](https://svl-devops-gitlab01.fortilab.fortinet.com/tec-content/devops/tec-user-guide).

{{%notice tip%}}
On every page, the title will be automatically added as H1 heading.
So you don't need to add `# Title` on top of the page.

Our hugo environment is based on
a hugo theme called relearn, you can refer to its [Documents](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/)
to find all details on its features and usage.

The TEC building environment has a lot of enhancements to make your document looks nice.
This chapter covers all of them.

Remember, if some feature documented here does not work on your local preview, it most likely
is because your local environment is not updated to the latest version. Follow the two steps
outlined in section [Upgrade](../chapter-01-start/05-upgrade.html) in chapter 1.
